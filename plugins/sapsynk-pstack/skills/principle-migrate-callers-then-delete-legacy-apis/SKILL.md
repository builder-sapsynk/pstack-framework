> Sapsynk host adapter: Read [the portable contract](../../adapters/CONTRACT.md) and the [Codex](../../adapters/codex.md) or [Claude Code](../../adapters/claude-code.md) mapping for the coordinating host before executing this workflow. Select the matching host adapter when running elsewhere; preserve the original requirements and report unavailable capabilities. Verify the pinned [framework identity](../../framework.json) before relying on this installation.

# Migrate Callers Then Delete Legacy APIs

- Update tests to assert the new contract, and delete tests that only protect pre-refactor implementation details

**When this applies:**
- No external users depend on backward compatibility
- The project can absorb coordinated breaking changes
- The new API is part of a simplification or refactor initiative
